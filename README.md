# rating-app

this is a simple app that i'm creating for my web design class. it's basically a hub where you can rate any video game that you want, but in a twitter/reddit mix ui.

key features: 
- can rate any game out of 5 stars 
- gain upvotes/downvotes 
- highlight controversial posts 
- find reviews by game name/category
