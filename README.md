hello everyone~ 
just wanted to let you all know that the site is back in working condition and is able to be tested and navigated (mostly). it is still under development so please keep that in mind, but other than that you are free to work with it and see what it does!

this is a simple app that i'm creating for my web design class. it's basically a hub where you can rate any video game that you want, but in a twitter/reddit mix ui.

key features: 
- can rate any game out of 5 stars 
- gain upvotes/downvotes 
- highlight controversial posts 
- find reviews by game name/category
