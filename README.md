!!!! IMPORTANT !!!! update: 20230515
hi everyone,
i'm updating this here so that it will be seen by all viewers of the repository. 
recently i've not been doing well mentally. i've been absent from my class quite a bit, so this whole project is essentially broken. 
if you were hoping to test out the code, i apologise; please do not do so until this message is cleared from this readme, as you will be very disappointed. 
during this time i'm going to be working on troubleshooting and problem-solving these issues, and updates may be less interesting in the meantime. 
thank you for understanding. life happens and things break. my friends on github will be the first to know when the project is in working condition once more. 

much appreciated, 
isa

this is a simple app that i'm creating for my web design class. it's basically a hub where you can rate any video game that you want, but in a twitter/reddit mix ui.

key features: 
- can rate any game out of 5 stars 
- gain upvotes/downvotes 
- highlight controversial posts 
- find reviews by game name/category
